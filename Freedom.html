        The concept of freedom is quite abstract and open to many interpretations. Some may see it as the right to vote and choose their leader, while others find their freedom in having control over their life, maybe in choosing their career. Freedom and liberty are perhaps the most accepted modern ideas of the global society. They are benchmarks for every nation in the contemporary world. However, freedom is still an unattainable dream for few and a mere privilege for others. It is something to be yearned for and earned through immense struggle or even bloodshed. Yet, such hard-earned freedom often happens to be a mere illusion painted in selfishness and irresponsibility.

  The ideas of freedom and independence are often used interchangeably, but in reality, they seldom mean the same thing. Independence is one’s birthright, something that could be qualitatively judged by the presence or absence of one’s rights and privileges. Freedom, however, is much more profound and personal. It is an emotion that can only be felt and understood.

  In recent times, we have seen people justify many cruel and inhumane actions in the name of freedom and rights. While it is a common assumption that freedom implies you get to choose whatever you wish for, the dilemma of choice only emerges when you are not sure of what you want to achieve. Directed thoughts executed with a focused mind and refined skills don't cause this dilemma. In this case, the focus is on the actions alone. However, execution of one's thoughts comes with countless external obstacles and distractions, and overcoming all of them is the only way to taste the true meaning of freedom. It enlightens your heart and soul and changes your perspective of the world.

  This is what, Rabindranath Tagore, a legend in the fields of art and literature, had to say about the idea of freedom:

</p>
 <p>
  Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
  <br>  Where knowledge is free;
<br>Where the world has not been broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
<br>Where words come out from the depth of truth;
<br>Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;

<br>Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;

<br>Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action,
<br>Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

 </p>
 <p>
  To understand the true essence of freedom, one must free their heart from fear, agitation, and expectation. Once we get rid of all the disappointment, sadness, and unpleasant memories in our minds, the world becomes the sky where we can fly like a bird with the wings of freedom.
