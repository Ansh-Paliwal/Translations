    <p>Any day to celebrate womanhood is often marked by the success stories of a few notable personalities.
      However, we as a society fail to acknowledge the existence of the ones whose dreams were shattered prematurely because of their identity as a girl.
      These struggles come into the limelight only after their success. On this International Day of Girl Child, we seek to be the voice of such suppressed stories from different factions of our society.

      People often get stuck in this quicksand of prostitution because of different circumstances.
      However, as a member of the Bachhada community, this profession is my fate. My name is Tarana, and I am seventeen years old.
      My typical evening is spent at the side of the Neemuch Manasoor Highway, under the dim red lights. With a smile plastered on my face, in hopes of gaining freedom someday, you will find me wearing colourful dresses and heavy makeup in the prospect of a customer.
      In a society that has normalised female infanticide, my community is an exception. Here, the birth of a girl child is celebrated.
      However, this isn’t to be confused with the progressive attitude we aspire to achieve today.
      In reality, this is a community that is ready to bid off a girl’s uterus in order to get 3 square meals. Prostitution has been the traditional profession here, with girl children being the breadwinner of the family, for ages. They are forced into the flesh trade at the tender age of ten or eleven. Their fathers or brothers act as pimps, who would readily trade their kin for money.
      Any attempts to escape from this fate have been in vain and, at times, even resulting in death.

      When I turned ten, my grandmother insisted that selling our bodies is what we were destined for. When I was twelve years old, the smile on my face was wiped off forever. My father and brother brought me to the same highway and left me there with a stranger. That day changed my life forever. At sixteen, my fate played a cruel trick and I gave birth to a baby girl.
In a society where a woman is seen as a human doll without any emotions, I am afraid that one more child will have to lose her dreams. This fear is etched in my mind and it keeps haunting me. Though I was silenced at the age of twelve, I am determined to muster the courage to raise my voice for the sake of my child. But, will I ever be heard? With the efforts being made by the government and NGOs to uproot such backward practices, I live on with hope that one day, at least my child will be liberated from this system.

        I'm a part of the Maasai community in the Western part of Nigeria where FGM is a norm that we've become accustomed to. My name is Kyasa, and I walk through these dusty lanes in hopes of creating awareness against this age-old tradition.

      </p>
      <p>
        When I reminisce about my childhood, I don't have any notable moments of happiness or nostalgia. I've been told by my father that my arrival into this world coincided with the same day as my mother's demise. Back then, I failed to understand this, but much later, I realised that it was a consequence of FGM. As I turned 11, my father marked the date of the dawn of a similar fate. That morning, my aunt was highly affectionate towards me, which was in stark contrast to how I was treated before. She helped me bathe and took me to a dilapidated hut in the outskirts of the village. Many girls like me were lined up in front of that hut. The atmosphere reeked of blood, with screams which were gut-wrenching. Soon, I noticed a girl being taken elsewhere with her legs stained with blood. My friend was standing in front of me, and she was next to go in. Through a small rift in the hut, I could view the inside of the room. Three older women held her, and one of them cut her clitoris. Her screams that followed seemed like a premonition from the universe that I must escape.I mustered the courage to pull away from the firm grip of my aunt and escaped. At that moment, I ran to one of the people I trusted most, my teacher. Everything that followed enabled me to escape from the grips of a gruesome fate. My teacher took me to a police station from where I was taken to rehabilitation. Sometimes when I look back, I fall into pangs of guilt. Maybe I shouldn’t have left home. But my further experiences in life assured me that my decision was for the best.

        After graduating, I joined an NGO that works to eradicate FGM. Presently, I travel to different parts of Nigeria to organise awareness camps and events to convey its detrimental impact. Today, about 200 million women around the world are survivors of this horrible crime. I have dedicated my whole life to them,to be their voice to the world. But one question always looms in the back of my mind. When will this horrible practice come to an end? Who is to blame for this perpetual cycle of tortures and where should change begin? Is it the men like my father who, even after seeing their wives meet such an end, push their daughters into this pithole? Or is it the women, who still believe that the validity of their identity lies in them going through this horrible practice? In hopes of finding an answer to this, and perseverance to continue my efforts.

      <p class="thick">Beyond identities</p>

      <p>
        As I questioned my identity, I realised that I was not my mother's son but rather her daughter. While my friends were attracted to girls, I was drawn to the idea of being a girl. My body turned into a prison that I yearned to escape. This is the story of my transition from Aadhavan to Athirai.
      Though women are often deemed as cherished flowers of femininity, why is the femininity that blossoms within us dismissed as a subject of curiosity?

      <p>
        My mother, who was my only family, worked as a daily wage worker, so that the two of us could get three square meals. After a year of struggling with my identity, as I turned 15, I finally decided to come out to my mother.  Even in cities and metropolitan areas, which are perceived as progressive areas that actively spoke about empowerment and equality, people in my shoes were still considered a liability. So, when my neighbours advised my mother that honour killing was the only solution, it didn’t come as a surprise to me. Rather, what fascinated me was my mother accepting me for who I was, despite coming from the very same regressive background.


      </p>
      <p>
        My mother feared that my life would languish. In hopes of better education or possibly in hopes of a better life, she sent me to a school near the city. But even there, the curiosity and sometimes the disgust towards me never died down. Despite all this, the few teachers who supported me and reached out, emerged like guardian angels. Throughout these struggles, the support systems became accelerators which helped me strive forward.

      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm an educated and financially independent <strong>woman</strong>. The same society that rejected me because of my identity now accepts me because of my present stature. But, it is undeniable that I’m privileged and would be seen as an exception from the rest of my community. Typically anyone like me would be hidden or even ousted from their homes by their family. The fundamental right to just live is a strife, let alone education. When bereft of options, begging by clapping their hands and succumbing to forced prostitution becomes the only solution.


      </p>
      <p>
        On this International Day of Girl Child, I wish that our society would support the ones who are struggling with their identity from an early age. I don’t want this day to be just about the strides made so far but also a day to think about those girls who seek liberation and lay the foundation for the path of a better future for <strong>all</strong> girls.
