  Oh hey! There comes another, flashing his backside, unashamed. Once again, I will be bestowed with his piss, and the ‘pleasant’ smell would be all over me. What have I become? From being a source of food for humans, I have been turned into a dumping place for their wastes. This goes on from ‘dusk till dawn’, I never get a break. One after the other, they all come as they please. All the children just pass by, covering their noses as the elderly try to convince their worn-out knees to do the ‘royal squat’. It’s been quite a while since the last ‘petrichor’. Nowadays, all I know is the smell of feces.

</p>
<p>
  On beautiful afternoons, as I lay sunkissed, I often see people doing their ‘business’, careless about being watched by someone beneath them. Apart from ruining my beauty, they also invite a plethora of diseases. I have been seeing people suffer from illnesses for decades now. Why does no one realise what they’re bringing upon themselves? I have become a host for God knows how many insects and other pests that attack these puny beings.

</p>
<p>
Pregnant women have a hard time relieving themselves. I have heard countless screams of pain. I feel bad for all those little girls who have to sit in this muck, while menstruating. My heart sinks seeing their plight. Illness by pests can be cured, but how can one cure this illness of humankind? I have seen men eve-teasing little girls in the dark nights. Some of them have dared to cross all boundaries. I want to drag them and bury them inside my depths. But alas! My hands are tied by my own destiny.
</p>
<p>
 One day, while glaring at the swaying crops, I overheard two farmers talk about how the government was planning to build a ‘toilet’ on this place- on me, perhaps? Finally, I can be at peace. There won’t be lumps of human-waste all over the place anymore. I would get a complete makeover. But as the second one heard this, he blasted off, “How can people belonging to different castes use the same toilet?” Both of them started quarelling and I was left pondering about this new ‘caste’ thing. All I had seen, for years, was humans coming and leaving dump all over me. When they come here and go about their business in the open, do their beliefs take a break? When the government finally decided to build a toilet and clean the place up to prevent outbreaks of illnesses, they were fighting like silly geese? It had been my responsibility, or rather misfortune, to assimilate their waste in me and keep the surroundings clean. These humans won’t ever ever let me be with peace, or maybe do my job at least, would they?

</p>
 <p>
   A few days later, a man, smart and well-dressed, came up to take my measurements. Big machines were brought to dig up the place and lay the foundation for the structure. Amidst the loud noises of the vehicles and machines, I could hear some of the villagers. Some wanted the construction to stop immediately, some disagreed. I endured an unimaginable amount of pain as machines scooped into me, while they kept fighting and the drama unfolded. I wanted to cry my eyes out. After a while they decided to stop to discuss the construction further. I sighed in relief. For the next few days, I got some rest. Nevertheless, I prepared myself for more rigorous pain when they resume. The pain didn’t seem to fade, the suffering continued to surge. They dug me up, breaking me bit by bit, dumped heavy things onto me, and I kept bearing, for the sake of its benefit. The process was quite a spectacle and it attracted a large crowd. The playful giggles and smiles of the kids who visited got me through those days.


 </p>
 <p>
   Now things have changed, perhaps for the better. With newly constructed toilets all around the village, lots of existing issues could be put to rest. Kids now have clean farms to roam around and young girls are no longer bothered about going in the open to relieve themselves. Many people have started to use toilets regularly, and I no longer continue to be ‘pissed off’. As expected, the elders were skeptical initially, but they seem to have suited themselves over time. The entire face of the village has changed for the better and finally, I have restored my petrichor this monsoon.
