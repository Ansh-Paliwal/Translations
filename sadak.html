    <p>After surviving a harsh night in the bitter cold, the sunlight interrupted my sleep. Upon the dawn of a new day, the entire world is filled with hope for the future. The warmth can melt the frozen ice on my stubby tail but for beings like us, this warmth falls short to melt the icy despair of darkness.

    </p>

        <p>
    All these things hold a meaning for those who sleep peacefully within the four walls, but for us, our eternal fight with death, seems like a battle which will bring nothing but mere disappointment.


    </p>
    <p>
     Hope is like an illusion, just as the rising sun might motivate you to stay optimistic, but the dusk sinks it somewhere underneath the calm waves as soon as it hits the time to leave. Days pass by like a boat floating in the ocean, hoping that one day it will find a shore to stay.
I forgot to mention, My name is Aadav and my six brothers, now four, and I live together with my mother under the old culvert of the city. One night, the other two brothers left us to find shelter somewhere else when the cold became unbearable. My thoughts wander through the sparkling stars in the night sky, wishing that someday, I would find my brothers again. Like everyday, the dust of this restless city was bestowing our tiny house, but the day felt ominous as if life had left the search for a new path.

      </p>
      <p>It has been our routine for a long time to go towards the big city every morning, hoping to find some food. There is a big factory near the culvert and a drain just beside it. Smoke rupting from that factory suffocates me, so i hold my breath to escape from it and bang!! I land straight into the drain. I yelp for help and my mother pulls me out while holding me by her mouth. All of us brothers march behind our mother in a queue.
</p>


      <p>
       I look at my face full of mud and dust on the big mirrors-like buildings and soon my mother drags me away from there. What wrong have I done now? Shouldn’t I even take a glance at my own face?
  </p>
      <p>
    While we roam around the street for food, the shopkeepers rarely throw us a few crumbs of bread or leftover food out of pity and some people drive us away by hitting us with sticks and stones. In the midst of it all, we kept running, having nowhere to go but the drain. I wonder, if we aren’t meant to be here? Are we so dirty that no one would like our company, avert away from us out of disgust? But all these thoughts are meaningless in front of hunger.

      </p>
      <p>
       The game of bread is very intruiging; children leave home to earn it, and when they reach the age of earning, they become so busy in their own world that both their home and family are long gone out of their lives. The cycle keeps repeating.

      </p>

        <p>Like every other day, I lagged behind my family as I was the youngest.
On the other side of the road, everyone had found something to satisfy their hunger. My eyes found solcae and i hoped my stomach would be comforted as well if i could reach the other side.
</p>


      <p>
       The feeling of satisfying my empty stomach drove me crazy and I started running, as if there was no world between me and that loaf of bread . But this irresponsible act led my name to be associated somewhere with thousands of animals dying every day after being hit by a vehicle.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was life on the other side of the road and a slow death on the current. Unknowingly, I chose a quick death. The misery had ended but in such an undesirable way. There is nothing wrong with me dying, the problem is that nobody bothered to stop. There was nothing new about that. It happens everyday that someone leaves unbothered, putting an end to someone else's life. There is another life written on that road.
     </p>
      <p>
     Next time, whenever you pass through that road, just think a little and look on your sides before moving ahead. If possible, put me a little away from that road, close to my mother.
See you again beyond the stars.
     </p>
      <p>
       

If only! Just breathing would have been enough to survive
If only! That bread would have been found before the road
If only! My feet would have been faster than those cars
If only! My will to live could have reached their hearts
If only! I could live a little longer
If only! I could play with my family again
If only! I could spend another cold night with my mother
If only! It would not have been so quick to rob me of my right to live
If only! I could see something else in the world
If only! I could live again…if only I could wish!!
