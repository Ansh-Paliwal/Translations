    <p>And that hot blazing sun was again there disturbing my sleep, soon after I had survived one more night in the bitter cold. That beginning of a new day is the moment when the whole world wakes up with new hopes. This warmth can melt the frozen ice on my little tail but for beings like us, this warmth falls shy to melt the icy despair of darkness.
All these things are true for those who sleep peacefully inside the four walls, but for us, our eternal fight with death now seems like an unending battle which will bring nothing but mere disappointment.

    </p>

        <p>
     Hope is an illusion, like the rising sun it might motivate you to stay optimistic, but later in the evening it sinks somewhere in the calm waves like the same sun. And the days go on flowing in the ocean of the world, in the hope that one day it will find a shore to stay.
Alas! I forgot to mention, My name is Aadav and I live with my other six, now four brothers and my mother under the old culvert in the city. The other two brothers left us to find some other shelter on a night when cold was getting past the bearable boundary. I sometimes look at the bright stars in the night sky, hoping that maybe somewhere in those stars I will meet my brothers again


    </p>
    <p>
     Like everyday, the dust of this restless city was binding our small house, but on this day something was different, as if life had left the search for a new path.
It has been our routine for a long time that we all go out to that big city every morning, hoping to get some food. There is a big factory near the culvert and a drain near it. Smoke erupting from that factory is very suffocating, so I hold my breath to escape from it and bang!! Landing straight in the drain, I start crying and my mother pulls me out while holding me by her mouth. All of us brothers march behind our mother in a line.

      </p>
      <p>Often I start looking at my face full of mud and dust in the big mirrors tucked in the buildings, soon my mother drags me away from there. What have I done now? Shouldn’t I even look at my own face ?
</p>


      <p>
       As usual I was roaming with my family in search of food. Sometimes, out of pity, the shopkeepers give us one or two loaves of bread or leftover food and some people drive us away by hitting us with sticks and stones. In the midst of all this, we kept running, having nowhere to go than our drain. I wonder are we not meant to be here? Are we so dirty that no one would like our company, always running away from us? But all these thoughts fall short in front of hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
     The game of bread is very interesting, children leave home to earn it, and when they reach the age of earning, they become so busy in their own world that both home and family members go far away from their lives. And the cycle continues.

      </p>
      <p>
        Like every day, I lagged behind my family, is being the youngest a problem ?
On the other side of the road, everyone had found something to satisfy their hunger, my eyes felt relief seeing this and maybe my stomach would be content as well once I would get to the other side.

      </p>

        <p>The feeling of satisfying my empty stomach drove me crazy and I just started running, as if there was no world between me and that bread loaf. But this irresponsible act led my name to be associated somewhere with thousands of animals dying every day after hitting a vehicle.
</p>


      <p class="thick">Beyond identities</p>

      <p>
       There was life on the other side of the road and a slow death on the current. And unknowingly I chose a quick death between the two. Yes, the misery had ended but in such an undesirable way. The issue is not that I died, the thing is that no one bothered to stop. And that wasn’t a new thing. Everyday someone leaves unbothered putting a full stop on someone's life. Another life is written in the name of that road.

      </p>
      <p>
        Next time onwards, whenever you pass through that road, then not much, but just think a little and look on your sides before moving ahead. If possible, put me a little away from that road, near my mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you again across the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       
If only! just breathing would have been enough to survive
If only! That bread would have been found before the road
If only! my feet would have been faster than those cars
If only! my will to live could have reached their hearts
If only! i could live a little longer
If only! i could play with my family again
If only! Another cold night i could sleep with my mother again
If only! This right to live would not have been taken away from me so soon
If only! i could see something else in the world
If only! I could live again… I wish, if only!!
