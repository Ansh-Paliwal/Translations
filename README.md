# LnD-website
This is a website containing the translated posts given by the Literary and Debating Club. <strong>index.html</strong> is the main page of the website, with <strong>contact-us.html</strong> being the subpage

The language posts are stored in the format 'FileName.html'. Longer names are written in shorter forms.

The current posts as of now are:  <ul>            
           <li> Freedom.html</li>
           <li> Int Girl Child.html</li>
           <li> WorldToiletDay.html</li>
            </ul>
 
There's a common css stylesheet- <style.css> for the website, but the translated language posts contains the original stye given. Some of the specific styles are provided in the html files itself for easier access.
